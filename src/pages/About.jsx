            Since her PhD about elite instrumental practice strategies, Deborah
            has published several papers on the subjects of identifying pitch
            errors and their sources, developed a Note-Time Playing Path and is
            currently completing a paper on Thematic coding of elite players
            practice and will soon publish material on her Model of Elite
            Practice
